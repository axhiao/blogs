After some thoughts I decided to move my tech blog over to GitHub. My main reasons are that writing code examples at Blogspot is plain annoying. Also I think that writing the blog posts in a plain text file is much easier for me than doing so at Blogspot's web interface.

So, I hope to be writing here soon about the technology I'm working with right now. Expect to read about Erlang, Clojure, Haskell, PHP, RabbitMQ and who knows what else :).

See you around soon!
